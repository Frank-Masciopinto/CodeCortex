                    <h3>Problems We Faced</h3>
                    <p className="pb-4">
                      One of the main hardware limitations we faced was the
                      MagTek USB Swipe Reader's compatibility issues with our
                      POS system. This caused unexpected errors and crashes,
                      leading to lost sales and revenue. To address this issue,
                      we conducted extensive research to identify compatible
                      hardware and worked closely with our hardware vendors to
                      ensure compatibility.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb-4">
                      Software bugs were also a significant challenge we faced
                      during the development process. We encountered the "Ghost
                      in the Machine" error, which caused the system to become
                      unresponsive due to a corrupted database. We worked
                      closely with our development team to identify the root
                      cause of the error and develop a solution that prevented
                      the error from occurring in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb-4">
                      Integration issues were also a significant challenge we
                      faced during the development process. Integrating our POS
                      system with a business's inventory management system led
                      to errors and delays in processing transactions and
                      managing inventory. To address this issue, we developed a
                      custom integration solution that streamlined the process
                      and provided real-time inventory data.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb-4">
                      Security concerns were also a significant challenge we
                      faced during the development process. POS systems often
                      handle sensitive customer information, such as credit card
                      data, making them a target for cyber attacks. To address
                      this challenge, we implemented robust security measures,
                      including multi-factor authentication, encryption, and
                      regular vulnerability assessments.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb-4">
                      Overall, these challenges required a team with technical
                      expertise and creative problem-solving skills to develop a
                      robust and reliable POS system. By working closely with
                      our vendors and development team, we were able to overcome
                      these challenges and deliver a system that met the needs
                      of our clients and their customers.

                  champ, tackling every challenge with ease and delivering a
                  system that's as reliable as a Swiss watch, but with more
                  buttons." - Francesco Masciopinto, CodeCortex CEO
