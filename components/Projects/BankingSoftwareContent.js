                    <h3>Problems We Faced</h3>
                    <p>
                      Before hiring us, Tai Sang Bank was facing several
                      challenges with its existing banking system. The system
                      was slow, with an average page load time of 6 seconds,
                      which is significantly longer than the average page load
                      time for online banking websites, which is around 2
                      seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This resulted in a frustrating user experience for
                      customers, who often abandoned their transactions due to
                      the slow page load times. Additionally, the system was not
                      scalable, and the bank could not accommodate the
                      increasing number of customers using its online banking
                      services. This resulted in long wait times for customers
                      trying to access the system, with an average wait time of
                      10 minutes per customer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Furthermore, the system was not user-friendly, and
                      customers often complained about the complexity of the
                      interface. This resulted in a high number of customer
                      complaints, with an average of 50 complaints per week
                      related to the online banking system.

              <h3>Objectives</h3>
              <p>
                Tai Sang Bank had several objectives in mind when they
                approached us to develop their online banking software. These
                objectives included streamlining their banking processes,
                reducing operational costs, improving customer satisfaction,
                enhancing security, and increasing online transactions. By
                achieving these objectives, Tai Sang Bank could remain
                competitive in the industry and provide customers with a modern
                and convenient banking experience. The online banking software
                we developed for them was designed to meet these objectives and
                provide them with a competitive advantage. By offering a
                seamless and secure online banking experience, Tai Sang Bank
                could improve customer satisfaction and encourage more customers
                to use their online services.

                After implementing our online banking software, Tai Sang Bank
                saw significant improvements in its operations and customer
                satisfaction. The software enabled the bank to provide customers
                with a more convenient and efficient banking experience,
                resulting in a 30% increase in online transactions. The software
                also reduced the average wait time for customers trying to
                access the system to just 1 minute per customer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, the bank's customer satisfaction levels increased
                significantly, with a 50% reduction in customer complaints about
                the online banking system. Customers appreciated the improved
                user interface and faster transaction times, which resulted in a
                25% increase in the bank's customer retention rate.
